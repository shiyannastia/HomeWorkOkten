<h2>Cole Sprouse is an American actor</h2>
<p>
    Cole and his brother, Dylan, began acting at the age of eight months following a suggestion from their grandmother,
    Jonine Booth Wright, who was a drama teacher and actress. Much of Sprouse's early career was shared with his brotherâ€”some
    of their earliest roles were shared roles as one baby or child in commercials, television shows, and films.
    Due to child labor laws in California restricting the amount of time children can be filmed in a day,
    casting twins in a single role allows more time for one character to be filmed
